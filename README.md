# AND101 Project 4 - CodeMath

Submitted by: **Dantes Nava**

Time spent: **5** hours spent in total

## Summary

**Code To Cofee** is an android app that **calculates how many cups of coffee you need after taking a break from hammering away at your code. (This app is intended to be silly, we do not reccommend actually drinking this many cups of coffee per minute of break time)**

If I had to describe this project in three (3) emojis, they would be: **â˜•ðŸ¤ªðŸ¥²**
